# RushTI PyPI Publish Workflow (Manual Fallback)
#
# This is a manual fallback for publishing to PyPI.
# The primary publish flow is handled by build.yml (after creating a release).
#
# Use this workflow to manually publish the current version on master to PyPI,
# e.g. if the automated publish failed and needs to be retried.
